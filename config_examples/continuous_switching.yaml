# Example configuration for continuous pump and valve switching
#
# This YAML file defines pump settings and a sequence of actions (run)
# for controlling a micropump and valve. You can edit the values to
# customize the behavior. Indentation and format are important!
#
# - Use spaces (not tabs) for indentation.
# - All colons (:) must be followed by a space.
# - Lines starting with '#' are comments and are ignored by the program.
#
# Sections:
#   1. pump settings: Define named pump profiles (voltage, frequency, waveform)
#   2. run: Sequence of actions to perform (turn pump on/off, operate valve)
#
# To add or change steps, copy/paste existing blocks and edit values.
#
# See the README or user guide for more details.

pump settings:
  # There is only one pump, but we can define different profiles for it.
  # Define named pump profiles here. You can add more profiles if needed.
  normal speed:
    waveform: RECT      # Shape of the pump signal (e.g., RECT = rectangular)
    voltage: 100        # Voltage to apply to the pump (in Volts)
    freq: 50            # Frequency of the pump signal (in Hz)
  slow speed:
    waveform: RECT      # Shape of the pump signal
    voltage: 50         # Voltage for slower operation
    freq: 30            # Frequency for slower operation (in Hz)

required hardware:
  pump: true             # Set to true if a pump is connected
  valve: true            # Set to true if a valve is connected
  pipetting robot: false # TODO: add support for pipetting robot control
  microscope: false # TODO: add support for microscope control
run:
  # Sequence of actions to perform. Each item is a step in the process.
  # Steps are executed in order, from top to bottom.

  - pump_on: normal speed  # Turn on the pump using the 'normal speed' settings above

  - duration: 40         # Run the pump for X seconds
    commands:
      # During the X seconds, repeat the following commands:
      - action: valve_on
        duration: 5       # Open the valve for 5 seconds
      - action: valve_off
        duration: 5       # Close the valve for 5 seconds
      # The valve will switch on and off every 5 seconds during the pump run

  - pump_off: 0           # Turn off the pump (the value '0' is ignored)

# Summary:
# This example runs the pump for 2 minutes, switching the valve on and off every 5 seconds.
# Then it repeats the process with a slower pump profile.
#
# To customize:
# - Change the 'voltage' or 'freq' values in 'pump settings' to change the liquid flow rate.
# - Change the 'duration' values for pump or valve steps.
# - Add more steps to the 'run' sequence as needed.
